Amazing 2D sandbox game based on Terraria

Download and Play Our Game! https://github.com/kylesoni/Safe-Space/blob/main/Safe%20Space.exe

## Instructions
On the title screen, click on easy or hard to start the game (easy will keep items on death, hard resets the game on death).

The controls are given in game, but for convenience:
- WASD to move, W or space to jump
- Equip items using number keys, clicking on the slot, or the scroll wheel
- Use equipped items with left click
- Enter inventory mode with Esc or I
- In inventory mode, click on items to "pick" them up and move them to different slots
- Picked up items can be dropped with right click
- Can also craft or exit the game in the inventory menu

The goal of the game is to have fun exploring. If that doesn't sound exciting, another goal is to craft a ship using various resources found in caves and the dugeon. Using the ship will give you the option to leave the game.
